        <p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.</p>
<p>在我年幼时，我的父亲给了我一些建议，这些建议我一直以来都念念不忘。</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”</p>
<p>他说：”当你想要批判一个人时，你需要明白这个世界上不是所有人都有你拥有的优越条件。</p>
<p>He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought–frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon–for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.</p>
<p>他没有再说很多，但我们总是说话有所保留，我也明白他另有深意。结果，我总是倾向于保留所有的评价，这个习惯打开了许多奇怪的人的心扉，却也让我成为了少数惹人厌者的受害者。当这种个性出现在一个正常的身上时，不同寻常的心灵会很快察觉，并被吸引，而结果就是，我在大学中被不公正的指责为一个政客，因为我了解这些放荡的，不为人知的男人的悲伤的秘密。大多数的秘密不是我有意去探寻–当我意识到一些将要倾诉隐私的征兆时，经常我不得不假装睡觉，或是全神贯注，抑或是漫不经心–对于一个年轻人的迫不及待想表达，或者至少部分具有剽窃性质，另外多有明显的隐瞒。对此保留评价表示具有无限的希望。我仍旧就害怕错过一些事，正如我父亲高傲的暗示我，也正如我高傲的重复着，基本礼仪道德生来就是分配不均的。</p>
<p>And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction–Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”–it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No–Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.</p>
<p>在夸耀我这一种宽容的方式后，我不得不承诺他有局限。人的行为可能建立在坚硬的石头或是潮湿的沼泽上，但在越过某一点后，我不再在意它建立于什么上。上个秋天，当我从东部回来时，我感觉我想让世界统一起来，永远处于一种道德的关注下。我不在想要带着高傲窥见别人内心的放浪的旅行了。只有盖兹比，他将自己的姓名赋予了这本书，在我的反感之外–盖兹比，却又代表了我所蔑视的所有事物。如果人格是一连串的成功的姿态，那么他的身上拥有华丽的光彩，对生命承诺的高度敏感，就像他与这些记录这些遥远地震的复杂机器相关一样。这种反应能力与那种软弱的被称为“创造性的性情”的印象无关–他有一种不同寻常的希望的天赋，一种浪漫的敏捷，这是我从未在其他任何人身上发现，同样我也认为我不在会发现的。不–盖兹比最后的结局是有道理的；而那些吞噬盖兹比的，那些伴随他梦想的肮脏的灰尘，使我暂时丧失对人们堕落的悲伤与短暂的欢愉的兴趣。</p>
<p>My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.</p>
<p>我祖上三代在这个中西部的城市代都卓越，富裕。卡尔维家族算是个世家，我们据说是布克娄奇公爵的后裔，但我们家族事实上的创建者是我的父亲的哥哥，他在51岁来到这，派人替他去参加了战争，开始了五金生意，而我的父亲直到今天仍旧继承着这份家业。</p>
<p>I never saw this great-uncle but I’m supposed to look like him–with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in Father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe–so I decided to go east and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, “Why–ye-es” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.</p>
<p>我从未见过这位伟大的伯祖父，但据说我长得应该很像他–特别参照挂在我父亲办公室里的相当硬朗的画像。我于1915年在纽黑文毕业，刚好比我父亲晚1&#x2F;4个世纪，不久之后我就参加了那场被称之为世界大战延迟的的日耳曼人迁徙。我是如此的享受那场反突击，以至于我回来后都平静不下来。相比于成为世界的温暖中心，中西部地区现在看来像是宇宙荒凉的边缘–所以我决定去东部，学习债卷生意，我认识的每个人都在做债卷生意，所以我想它一定能支撑一个单身汉。我的叔伯姑姨们商量了一番，就像他们为我选学前学校一样，最后带着严肃与犹豫的表情说：“为什么…啊…好吧”。我的父亲决定资助我一年，然后又几经耽搁，我最终在22的春天去了东部，那时我想我永远不会回来了。</p>
<p>The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.</p>
<p>过去后切实要做的事是要在城市里找到住所，但那时已经是温暖的季节了，我也才刚离开一个宽阔草坪与宜人树木的地方，所以，当我们办公室的一个年轻人建议我们一起在一个通勤小巷租房住时，我认为那是个不错的提议。他找到一个房子，一个饱经风霜的纸板平房，每月80元，但在在最后一刻，公司派他去华盛顿，而我独自一人去了乡下。我有一只狗，至少在它离开时我拥有它有一些天，一辆老道奇汽车，和一个为我铺床做早餐的芬兰女佣人，有时边她边在电炉灶上做饭，一边咕哝着芬兰的智慧。</p>
<p>It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.</p>
<p>我在最开始的几天十分孤独，直到一个比我新来乍到的人把我拦在路上。</p>
<p>“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.</p>
<p>“请问如何去西卵村呢”他无望的问。</p>
<p>I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>我告诉了他。之后，在我继续行走的路上，我不在感到孤独。我是一个向导，一个寻路者，一个原始定居者。他他无意中授予了我在这一带的存在感。</p>
<p>And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees–just as things grow in fast movies–I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.</p>
<p>就在者阳光照耀下，树叶茂密生长–就像电影里的东西一样长得快–我有那样的信念，我相信生活在这个夏天又重新开始了。</p>
<p>There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college–one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the “Yale News”–and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram–life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.</p>
<p>一方面我又太多的东西要读了，另一方面我也从宜人空气中汲取了很多营养。我买了一大关于银行、信贷方面与投资安全方面的书籍，他们五花八门地被我摆在书架上，就像铸币厂地新钱一样，准备展开迈达斯，摩根，密西拿斯财富的光辉秘密。我也有很高的热情去读其他的一些书籍。我在大学相当有文学性–我写了一系列关于耶鲁新闻的非常庄严与平淡的社评–我现在将要把所有这样的事纳入我的生活，然后成为最浅薄的所有方面的专家，也就是所谓的“全才”。这不仅仅是一句格言–“从一个方面去看生活会成功得多”。</p>
<p>It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals–like the egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact end–but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.</p>
<p>我在北美最奇怪的村镇租房这件事是一个巧合，它位于那个细长的扭曲的岛上，这个小岛一直延伸到纽约正东部，在那除了自然奇观意外，还有两块不同寻常的陆地形态。城市的200km以外是一对巨大的鸡蛋的半岛，轮廓相同，仅仅被小湾分割，延伸进西半球那片最恬静的盐水里，伸进长岛海峡的大湿地中。他们不是完美的椭球形–就像在哥伦布故事里的的鸡蛋，他们在接触端就像被压扁了一样–但他们的物理上的相似性一定是造成飞在上方的海鸥的疑惑的原因。对于无翼者，一个更<br>引人注目的现象是他们除了大小和形状以外所有的不同之处。</p>
<p>I lived at West Egg, the–well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard–it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires–all for eighty dollars a month.</p>
<p>我居住在西边的岛–嗯，也是两者中更简陋的地方，虽然这是一个最浅的标签来表达两者之间力气险恶的对比。<br>我的房子在小岛的最末端，离海峡只有50码，挤在两座每季租金12-15k的大别墅中间。在我右边的别墅是一个巨大的事物，不论以什么标准–这是对诺曼底Hôtel de Ville的真实模仿，在它旁边有一座高塔，上面疏疏落落地覆盖着一层常春藤，一个大理石游泳池，与超过40英尺的草坪面积。那是盖兹比的大厦。更确切的说，我在这时还不认识盖兹比先生，我只知道这是一位叫盖兹比的先生居住的大厦。我自己的房子是比较丑陋，辛亏很小，一般都会被忽视掉，所以我有幸看到一片海景，邻居的草地，与一种接近百万富翁的安慰感–所有的这一切只需要每月80美元。</p>
<p>Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.</p>
<p>穿过平静的海岸线，美丽的东岛上，白色的宫殿沿着水面闪闪发光，这个夏天的故事从我开车去那与Tom Buchanans共进晚餐真正开始。Daisy是我的远方表妹，Tom是我在大学里认识的。就在战争结束后不久，我与他们在芝加哥玩了两天。</p>
<p>Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven–a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy–even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach–but now he’d left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.</p>
<p>他的丈夫，除了许多的运动成就以外，曾经是纽黑文有史以来最伟大的橄榄球运动员之一–某种角度，是个全国闻名的人物，是这些在21岁就达到极端优秀成就，之后就走下坡路的人之一。他的家庭非常富有–甚至在大学里他的金钱自由是被人责备–但现在，他离开了芝加哥，以一种让你窒息的方式来到东部：比方说，他从森林湖运来整整一群打马球用的马匹。在我这一辈人中竟然还有人阔到能够干这种事，实在令人难以置信。</p>
<p>Why they came east I don’t know. They had spent a year in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it–I had no sight into Daisy’s heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.</p>
<p>我不知道他们为什么来东部。他们已经在法国呆了一年，因为没什么特别的原因，然后东奔西走去这些和这些富人玩马球，这次是永远的搬家了，黛西在电话里说到，但我不相信它–我看不透黛西的心思，但我觉得Tom将会永远略有惆怅的为追寻一场精彩的球赛无法重复的球赛而奔走。</p>
<p>And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens–finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.</p>
<p>就这样，在那个温暖多风的晚上，我开车去了东边的岛，去看两位我几乎不了解的两位老朋友。他们的房子比我想象中的更大，一种振奋的红色与白色的豪宅俯瞰着海湾，草地从海湾开始，直到前门，足足有1&#x2F;4miles，跨过日晷，砖石小路，与熠熠生辉的花园–最终，当它到房子前，好像借助了它奔跑的动量，便发散开来成为绿油油的常青藤。房子的正面有法式长窗，正闪烁着金色，面向下午温暖的风大开着，Tom Buchanan穿着骑装正站在前廊。</p>
<p>He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body–he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage–a cruel body.</p>
<p>他自纽黑文之后变了许多。现在他是一个壮实的，稻草头发的30岁男性，不仅嘴硬，还目空一切。一双闪耀，傲慢的眼神已经在他的建立了支配地位，让他总是一副盛气凌人的样子。即使是那件便宜的骑装也掩盖不了他的身体的力量–他仿佛填满了那双雪亮的皮靴，把上面的带子绷得紧紧的，你也能想像看见一堆肌肉的移动当他的肩膀在他的外套下移动。他的身体就像控制了巨大的杠杆–一个残忍的身体。</p>
<p>His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked–and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.</p>
<p>他的说话声音，粗暴的沙哑的男高音，加强了他的脾气暴躁的印象。那里面有一丝父亲的蔑视，即使是对他喜欢的人–在纽黑文有很多人讨厌他的胆量。</p>
<p>“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.</p>
<p>“你可不要认为我在这些事情上是说了算的，”他仿佛在说，仅仅是因为我比你更强壮更男人。“我们在同一个高中社会，虽然我们从不亲密，我总感觉他很支持我，总是带着他的粗狂的，挑衅的惆怅，希望我喜欢他。</p>
<p>We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.</p>
<p>我们在明亮的门廊交流了几分钟。</p>
<p>“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.</p>
<p>“我这地方还不错吧，”他说，他的眼神闪烁着，不知疲倦。</p>
<p>Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore.</p>
<p>他用一只胳膊把我转过身，伸出一只巨大的手指点着前面的远景，挥手扫过了一座下沉的意大利花园，半英里的浓郁的玫瑰花和一艘潮汐起伏的船。</p>
<p>“It belonged to Demaine the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”</p>
<p>“它属于石油大王Demaine，”再次转向我，礼貌又突然的说：“我们进去吧。”</p>
<p>We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling–and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.</p>
<p>我们穿过了高高的走廊进入了玫瑰花色的空间，在任意一端都有法式落地窗嵌入。落地窗半开着，闪着白光与与外面绿油油的草地相称，就像长出了一条路进入房间一样。一整微风穿过房间，吹起窗帘，就像白色的旗帜，吹起它们向天花板上磨砂般的结婚蛋糕般的装饰–轻轻拂过酒红色的地毯，就像风吹过海面一样留下阴影。</p>
<p>The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.</p>
<p>在这屋里唯一完全静止的东西就是一个巨大的沙发椅，上面有两个年轻女人好像漂浮在一个固定的气球上。他们都身着白色长裙，长裙飞舞着就像她们刚绕房子飞了一圈，被吹回来似的。我一定已经听了好一会窗帘刮动的劈啪声和墙上图片的呻吟。突然，Tom嘣的一声关上了后窗，房间周围的风都消失了，窗帘，地毯，两位女士都慢慢的降落地面。</p>
<p>The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it–indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.</p>
<p>年轻的那位女士于我很陌生。她在沙发的一端平躺着，一动不动，下巴稍稍仰起，就像她在平衡一件东西，生怕它掉下来一样。如果她从眼角中看到我，虽然事实上没有，我就将惊讶的为我进来打扰她这件事向她道歉。</p>
<p>The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise–she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression–then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.</p>
<p>“I’m p-paralyzed with happiness.”</p>
<p>She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)</p>
<p>At any rate Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again–the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.</p>
<p>I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth–but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.</p>
<p>I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.</p>
<p>“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.</p>
<p>“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there’s a persistent wail all night along the North Shore.”</p>
<p>“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she added irrelevantly, “You ought to see the baby.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to.”</p>
<p>“She’s asleep. She’s two years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—-“</p>
<p>Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“What you doing, Nick?”</p>
<p>“I’m a bond man.”</p>
<p>“Who with?”</p>
<p>I told him.</p>
<p>“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.</p>
<p>This annoyed me.</p>
<p>“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “I’d be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.”</p>
<p>At this point Miss Baker said “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started–it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.</p>
<p>“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.”</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted. “I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.”</p>
<p>“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, “I’m absolutely in training.”</p>
<p>Her host looked at her incredulously.</p>
<p>“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”</p>
<p>I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.</p>
<p>“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody there.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know a single—-“</p>
<p>“You must know Gatsby.”</p>
<p>“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”</p>
<p>Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.</p>
<p>Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.</p>
<p>“Why CANDLES?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”</p>
<p>“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.</p>
<p>“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me helplessly. “What do people plan?”</p>
<p>Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.</p>
<p>“Look!” she complained. “I hurt it.”</p>
<p>We all looked–the knuckle was black and blue.</p>
<p>“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to but you DID do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great big hulking physical specimen of a—-“</p>
<p>“I hate that word hulking,” objected Tom crossly, “even in kidding.”</p>
<p>“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.</p>
<p>Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here–and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.</p>
<p>“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or something?”</p>
<p>I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way.</p>
<p>“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read ‘The Rise of the Coloured Empires’ by this man Goddard?”</p>
<p>“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be–will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”</p>
<p>“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—-“</p>
<p>“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.</p>
<p>“You ought to live in California–” began Miss Baker but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.</p>
<p>“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are and you are and—-“ After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again. “–and we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization–oh, science and art and all that. Do you see?”</p>
<p>There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically. “It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”</p>
<p>“That’s why I came over tonight.”</p>
<p>“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose—-“</p>
<p>“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.</p>
<p>“Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position.”</p>
<p>For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened–then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.</p>
<p>The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.</p>
<p>“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a–of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation. “An absolute rose?”</p>
<p>This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.</p>
<p>Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.</p>
<p>“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor—-“ I said.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”</p>
<p>“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.</p>
<p>“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody knew.”</p>
<p>“I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Why—-“ she said hesitantly, “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”</p>
<p>“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.</p>
<p>Miss Baker nodded.</p>
<p>“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.</p>
<p>“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gayety.</p>
<p>She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away—-“ her voice sang “—-It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”</p>
<p>“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the stables.”</p>
<p>The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing–my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.</p>
<p>The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.</p>
<p>Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.</p>
<p>“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t back from the war.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”</p>
<p>Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.</p>
<p>“I suppose she talks, and–eats, and everything.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”</p>
<p>“Very much.”</p>
<p>“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about–things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool–that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.”</p>
<p>“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so–the most advanced people. And I KNOW. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated–God, I’m sophisticated!”</p>
<p>The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.</p>
<p>Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the “Saturday Evening Post”–the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.</p>
<p>When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.</p>
<p>“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”</p>
<p>Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.</p>
<p>“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”</p>
<p>“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy, “over at Westchester.”</p>
<p>“Oh,–you’re JORdan Baker.”</p>
<p>I knew now why her face was familiar–its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.</p>
<p>“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”</p>
<p>“If you’ll get up.”</p>
<p>“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”</p>
<p>“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of–oh–fling you together. You know–lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—-“</p>
<p>“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a word.”</p>
<p>“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”</p>
<p>“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.</p>
<p>“Her family.”</p>
<p>“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.”</p>
<p>Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.</p>
<p>“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.</p>
<p>“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—-“</p>
<p>“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?” demanded Tom suddenly.</p>
<p>“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—-“</p>
<p>“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.</p>
<p>I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called “Wait!</p>
<p>“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were engaged.”</p>
<p>“It’s libel. I’m too poor.”</p>
<p>“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people so it must be true.”</p>
<p>Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come east. You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage.</p>
<p>Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich–nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms–but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.</p>
<p>Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone–fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.</p>
<p>I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone–he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward–and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.</p>
